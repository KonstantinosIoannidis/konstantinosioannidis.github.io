Abstract: The purpose of this study is the statistical analysis of rainfall events to explore patterns and dependencies that would allow the generalization in cases of missing or truncated data. More specifically, in this paper we estimate intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves, which are widely used to model rainfall. We use data from a meteorological station in Eresos, Greece and estimate the parameters of the model for fixed return periods. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to check whether the estimates are optimal. Finally, a more general model is applied that allows for simultaneous modeling of rainfall duration, intensity and frequency (via return periods).

Keywords: rainfall modeling, nonâ€“linear regression, intensity-duration-frequency curves, sensitivity analysis, Monte Carlo simulation
