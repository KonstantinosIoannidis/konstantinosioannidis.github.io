Course description: Adopting a formal (i.e. mathematical) approach, the module deals with the foundations of economics, examining the behaviour of the two most basic agents of the economy, the consumer and the firm, their interaction in markets, and social decisions. The module emphasises the formal derivation of results and problem solving. The main theoretical devices employed are optimization theory and elements of game theory, while mathematical techniques with which students are unfamiliar will be explained during the module.
