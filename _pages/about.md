I am Konstantinos Ioannidis, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a href="https://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Economics Faculty</a> of the University of Cambridge. I am part of the <a href="https://lipne.econ.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Leverhulme International Professorship in Neuroeconomics Lab</a> lead by professor <a href="https://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/people/faculty/plb32" target="_blank">Peter Bossaerts</a>. Our focus is on how computational complexity affects decision making and how markets can help individuals solve complex problems.

My primary research fields are Behavioral Economics, Experimental Economics, and Game Theory. I enjoy researching the dichotomy between honest and dishonest communication, and habit formation. I am also interested in the synergies of economics and computer science, and collaborate as a Visiting Researcher with the <a href="https://www.cambridgecybercrime.uk/" target="_blank">Cambridge Cybercrime Centre</a> of the University of Cambridge.

I obtained my PhD in Economics at <a href="https://www.creedexperiment.nl/creed/peopleindex.php" target="_blank">CREED</a> at the University of Amsterdam under the supervision of <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/o/f/t.j.s.offerman/t.j.s.offerman.html" target="_blank">Theo Offerman</a> and <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/s/l/r.sloof/r.sloof.html" target="_blank">Randolph Sloof</a> in 2024. I hold three MSc diplomas in Economics, Mathematics, and Statistics.
