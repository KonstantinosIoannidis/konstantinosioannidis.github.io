<p align="justify">I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a href="https://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Cambridge</a>. I am part of the <a href="https://lipne.econ.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Leverhulme International Professorship in Neuroeconomics Lab</a> lead by professor <a href="https://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/people/faculty/plb32" target="_blank">Peter Bossaerts</a>. I am also affiliated with <a href="https://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/contacts/directories/rokos-postdoctoral-research-associates" target="_blank">Queens' College</a> and the <a href="https://www.cambridgecybercrime.uk/" target="_blank">Cambridge Cybercrime Centre</a>.</p>

<p align="justify">My primary research fields are Behavioral Economics, Experimental Economics, and Game Theory. Our lab focus is on how computational complexity affects decision making and how markets can help individuals solve complex problems. I also research the dichotomy between honest and dishonest communication, and habit formation. A preview of my research is below. This was my first time ever shooting a video!
