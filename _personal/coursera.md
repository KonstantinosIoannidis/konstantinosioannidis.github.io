<p align="justify">I discovered the world of MOOC (Massive Online Open Courses) when I enrolled on my first one in November of 2012. It was a course on Coursera platform called Introduction to Astronomy offered by Duke University and taught by Ronen Plesser. I got immediatelly hooked and was amazed about the variety of topics one could learn about. The journey through knowledge was both stimulating as well as addictive and lasted until the summer of 2015. I completed a range of courses during that time.</p>

<p align="justify">Surprising as it may sound, my Coursera endeavors helped me discover a new passion in research. One of the courses I took in Coursera was "A beginner's Guide to Irrational Behavior" offered by Duke University and taught by Dan Ariely. It covered a range of topics where human behavior is systematically and predictably irrational. This course was a deciding factor in my decision to change academic field from mathematics and statistics to behavioural and experimental economics. It triggered a domino of choices that eventually lead me to the University of Amsterdam.</p>

<p align="justify">As a final note, I highly recommend taking online courses in fields that are far from the area of your own expertise. From my personal experience, they can really broaden your horizons.</p>

<p align="justify">All the courses I successfully completed during that time are below.</p>
